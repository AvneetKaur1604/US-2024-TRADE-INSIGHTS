# US Global Trade Analysis (2024) - Power BI Capstone Project

This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing the United States' global trade performance for the year 2024. The analysis includes trade volumes, trade deficits, tariff responses, and efficiency scores across 200+ countries. The project integrates data analytics and visual storytelling to uncover key insights related to trade dynamics and policy implications.

## Project Objective

To analyze and visualize the impact of the 2025 proposed US tariff policies (including a universal 10% import tariff and up to 60% on goods from China) on global trade patterns. The goal is to interpret data-driven insights to support strategic decisions, policy review, and economic forecasting.

## Key Questions Explored

- Which countries experienced the highest tariff responses under the Trump policy?
- Which countries dominate US imports and exports?
- How concentrated is US trade across countries?
- Which nations show the largest trade deficits with the US?
- How efficient are US trade relationships based on import-export ratios?

## Dashboards Included

1. **Global Trade Performance Overview**
   - Total imports and exports
   - Top trade partners by volume and efficiency score
   - Trade deficit by country
   - Export volume distribution

2. **Top Trade Partners & Tariff Actions**
   - Geographical visualization of tariff responses
   - Trade deficit by region
   - Average tariff response metrics

3. **Nation-Specific Economic Snapshot**
   - Country-wise trade breakdown
   - Population and total trade volume
   - Surplus/deficit indicators
   - Tariff impact details

## Tools and Technologies

- Power BI (DAX measures, maps, custom visuals)
- SQL (data transformation, CTEs, joins, window functions)
- Python (data preprocessing using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)

## Data Sources

- Public trade datasets (cleaned and merged for visualization)
- Derived metrics such as tariff response and efficiency scores

## Key Insights

- The US imported approximately 3.27 million units and exported 2.07 million units in 2024.
- The European Union accounted for the highest share in both imports and exports.
- China had the largest trade imbalance with the US.
- A small group of countries (less than 10) contributed to over 80% of US imports.
- Trade efficiency varies significantly across small island nations and large economies.

## Implications for India

- Potential to benefit from US reshoring and supply chain diversification.
- Opportunity to negotiate sector-specific tariff reductions in IT and pharmaceuticals.
- Scope for expanding partnerships with the European Union and African markets.
